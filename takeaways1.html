<h1>Takeaways for Week 1</h1>

<h2>Topics</h2>

<h3>Knowledge Organization</h3>

<p class="counter">
There are many examples of knowledge organisation systems, some of which are the wikipedia, Databases, the World Wide Web. The purpose of these systems, as their title already indicates, is to organise the huge amount of knowledge/information that might exist within a specific domain, in a way that makes it easier and faster to us to access information and make use of it. This knowledge is represented in many different ways, where knowledge representation examples include Natural Language Text, Database Entries, Diagrams. Knowledge organisation is to some extend similar to machine learning, where both are subfield of artificial intelligence. However,   knowledge organisation is done manually by humans where automatic reasoning can be performed, whilst machine learning is done by the computer to find patterns in data. Four types of knowledge organisation exist: organization of Physical things, Information about physical things, Digital things:, Information about digital things. Knowledge organization can be done by the cooperation between different parties: Knowledge Representation Experts, Domain Experts, Non-Expert Users, Crowdsourcing Workers.

<h2>Literature</h2>

<h3>Voida et al. 2011</h3>

<p class="counter">
Voida et al. (2011) conducted a qualitative study with nonprofit organizations in the United States. They studied the information management practices of volunteer coordinators, who are responsible for organising and managing the information about volunteers, e.g. contact information, experience, and schedules. With very little support and training in information technology, the volunteer coordinators created their own information management systems, and they called them “homebrew databases”. The choice of the homebrew databases to be used depends on a number of features: 1) how diverse and fluid the information needs, stakeholders, and work contexts are, and 2) the  constraints in time, funding, and expertise. 
These systems are still insufficient for the coordinators’ needs, and each system has its own shortcomings. As a result, volunteer coordinators face difficulties/ and technical constraints with managing the information about volunteers, and they wish to have only one software, in which they can acces and manage all information they need. 
Voida et al. (2011) suggest future work in which more human-centred databases are designed, which can be easily accessible by staff with little expertise in information technology. Voida et al. (2011) also suggest developing mechanisms that facilitate data migration between different datasets.

<h3>Guha et al. 2016</h3>

<p class="counter">
Guha et al. (2016) describe the stages in which data has been structured on the Web. The early goal was to enable many different applications to use data from different sources. Many attempts took place to enable accessibility to structured data, e.g. the XML attempt to standardize the syntax on the Web. Schema.org was introduced in 2011, by the major search engines Google,  Bing, and Yahoo, where to goal was to provide web developers  a single vocabulary. Data structured following the schema.org standards, are being used in many places, such as email messages. The success of schema.org was been measured by the level of adoption of schema.org mark-ups, which is considered to be very high. This success is due to a number of design decisions taken when schema.org vocabulary was being developed, for example, the ability for webmasters to choose between the syntaxes the one they prefer.
